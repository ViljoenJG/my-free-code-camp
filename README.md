# My Free Code Camp curriculum

I decided to add my freeCodeCamp algorithms, challenges and projects to GitHub for my reference.

If you came here because you are busy with the freeCodeCamp curriculum I encourage you to try the challenges yourself first. If you decide to copy my solutions, please make an effort to understand the code before you submit.
